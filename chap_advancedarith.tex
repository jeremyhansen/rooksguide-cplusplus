Advanced arithmetic in C++ includes mathematics that can't be used in code 
without the use of the \texttt{<cmath>} library. 
This is mathematics that goes above and beyond the primitive operations: 
addition (\texttt{+}), subtraction (\texttt{-}), multiplication (\texttt{*}), 
and division (\texttt{/}). 
As we have seen before, some simple arithmetic might look like:
	
\begin{lstlisting}
	int x;
	x = 1;
	x += 5;
	return x;
\end{lstlisting}
	The variable \texttt{x} is declared as an integer. 
	The next line sets it to one. 
	The \texttt{+=} operator adds five to \texttt{x}, which makes \texttt{x} contain six.

% TODO: NOTE: FIXME: Is the return statement in the above snippet necessary?
% --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Doing simple operations like these does not require any special libraries or 
unusual commands. Any compiler can look at a \texttt{+}, \texttt{-}, 
\texttt{*}, or \texttt{/} in a line of code and know exactly what the programmer 
expects to happen. Some math requires a little extra help, though. In this case, 
help is the \texttt{<cmath>} library.
 
\texttt{<cmath>} is a library that is needed for trigonometric, hyperbolic, 
exponential, logarithmic, rounding, and absolute value functions. 
	The \texttt{<cmath>} library is designed to make your life simple and to 
make complicated mathematics easier in C++. 
	Using the \texttt{<cmath>} library in code is as simple as including it at 
the top of your source code file with the rest of your libraries. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <iostream>	
#include <cmath>
\end{lstlisting}

	After the inclusion of the \texttt{<cmath>} library, you can use certain 
mathematical functions in your code such as \texttt{pow(x, y)}, which raises 
the parameter \texttt{x} to the power of parameter \texttt{y}, and 
\texttt{sqrt(z)}, which returns the square root of \texttt{z}. 
	In your first few C++ programs you will probably not use the more advanced 
mathematical functions included in the \texttt{<cmath>} library, but for a full 
list of the functions provided in \texttt{<cmath>}, refer to ``Further Reading'' 
at the end of this chapter. 

\LevelD{Examples}

\LevelE{\texttt{pow()}}
	\texttt{pow} is the function called when you want to raise a value or 
variable to a certain power. Take a look at the code below and 
we'll break it down line by line.

\begin{lstlisting}
int x, y;
x = 4;
y = pow(x + 1, 3) + 6;
\end{lstlisting}

	First, we are declaring two variables: \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}. 
	After that we set \texttt{x} to 4. 
	Now we get to a more interesting section of code. 
	We are asking the compiler to raise the value of \texttt{x} plus 1 to the power of 3, add 6, and then place the result in \texttt{y}. 
	
	To use the \texttt{pow} function, you must understand its syntax. 
	Here is the breakdown:

\begin{lstlisting}
	pow (starting value, power being raised)
\end{lstlisting}

 	So for \texttt{pow (x + 1, 3) + 6}, we are raising the starting value 
\texttt{x}~+~1 to the power of 3. 
 	Before the power of 3 is applied, 1 is added to \texttt{x}. 
 	In this case it is the simple operation of 4+1, which yields 5. 
 	After we get 5, we raise it to the 3\textsuperscript{rd} power to get a value of 125. 
 	After we reach the value of 125 we are finished with the \texttt{pow} 
function and resume using normal operators when we add 6 to 125 resulting in 
the final value of 131.  
	

	Undoubtedly there are more complicated uses of the \texttt{pow} function, such as multiple uses of \texttt{pow} in the same line of code. 
	You might use multiple \texttt{pow} operations in code that calculates the length of one side of a triangle using the Pythagorean Theorem. 
	Look at the following code and see if you can figure out what the output value would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
  int x, y, z;
  x = 3;
  y = x + 1;
  z = pow(x, 2) + pow(y, 2);
  cout << z;
\end{lstlisting}

	If you got 25, then you have the right answer! 
	A breakdown reveals that after initializing the variables \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} and setting their values (3 for \texttt{x} and \texttt{x}+1 for \texttt{y}), we raise each value to the power of 2. 
	For visual reference,

\begin{lstlisting}
	z = pow (3, 2) + pow (x+1, 2);
\end{lstlisting}
results in
\begin{lstlisting}
	z = 9 + 16;
\end{lstlisting}	
	
	\texttt{z}'s value is set to 25. 
	The \texttt{pow} function is simple to use and can make operations used in 
a program simpler from both a computing and visual standpoint.

\LevelE{\texttt{sqrt()}}
	Square roots are calculated using the \texttt{sqrt} function. 
	Take a look at the example below to see how it is called in a program:

\begin{lstlisting}
  int a, b;
  a = 25;
  b = sqrt(a);
\end{lstlisting}

%*************************** NOTE. The text below is misleading.
%sqrt() only ever returns a double; its prototype is double sqrt(double x);
%**************************************************************************

	\texttt{sqrt} is simpler than \texttt{pow} in that it only requires one parameter. 
	Since \texttt{sqrt} returns a \texttt{float} or \texttt{double}, you should usually assign the result to a \texttt{float} or \texttt{double} variable, but in this example, \texttt{sqrt} returns exactly 5, so it can be converted to an \texttt{int} without any issues. 
	
	There are cases where both \texttt{sqrt} and \texttt{pow} are used in the same formula, such as when calculating the distance between two points. 
	When writing such code, it is very important to keep track of the parentheses and to use correct syntax. 
	One such syntax mistake is made when programmers think that C++ syntax is the same as algebraic syntax. 
	This is \emph{not} the case in C++!

\begin{lstlisting}
  int x = (5)(pow (3, 3));
\end{lstlisting}

is NOT correct syntax. 
When the compiler sees this, it doesn't view it as multiplication, but instead as (according to a professional), ``function shenanigans.'' 
It is important to be explicit with mathematical symbols in C++. 
So instead of the incorrect code above, use:

\begin{lstlisting}
int x = 5 * (pow (3, 3));
\end{lstlisting}

	Now, as an example, we will use code to compute the distance between two points on a plane.
	 Refer to the code and the diagrams if you do not understand or get lost.

\begin{lstlisting}
int x1, x2, y1, y2;
float dist;
x1 = 4;
y1 = 4;
x2 = 6;
y2 = 10;

dist = sqrt(pow (x2 - x1, 2) + pow (y2 - y1, 2));
cout << dist;
\end{lstlisting}
	
	So your final answer after the calculation is executed is roughly 6.342555. 
	Without the help of the advanced arithmetic operations, getting to this result would be a difficult, long, drawn-out process. 
	\texttt{pow} and \texttt{sqrt} are handy little functions that make life easier, all with the help of the \texttt{<cmath>} library.

\LevelE{Modulo}
The modulo operator (the percent sign: \texttt{\%}) finds the remainder, or what was left over from division. 
This program uses the modulo operator to find all prime numbers (all the numbers that never have a remainder of 0 when divided by every number except 1 and itself) that can be held by an \texttt{int}.

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int testprime = 0, divby = 0, remainder = 0;
	bool isprime;
	cout << "Prime Number Finder" << endl;
	while(testprime < 2147483647)//The Maximum for int
	{
    	isprime=true;
    	testprime++;
    	for(divby=2; divby < testprime; divby++)
    	{
        	remainder = testprime % divby; // store the remainder of the current number when divided by divby
        	if (remainder == 0)//If the number is not prime
        	{
            	isprime = false;
		break;
        	}
    	}
    	if (isprime)//If it passes the test, it is prime.
    	{
        	cout << " " << testprime; // tell us what the prime number is.
    	}
	}
	return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
