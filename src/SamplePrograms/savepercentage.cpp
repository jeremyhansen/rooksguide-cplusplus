    system("PAUSE"); //makes program pause and wait for user to acknowledge that it has done what they want
    return 0; //ends program
}

//Fix 1:
//By replacing the integers above with doubles of the same name, the problem is solved and //the division occurs as it is intended to
//    double shots, goals, saves, save_perc; //declares variables of type double to be used in division and to store final answer

//I know there are other ways to do it, is anyone good at them? Because Iâ€™m not.
